# Editing Converter Capabilities Safely

This guide describes the safest workflow to edit [converter-capabilities.json](../converter-capabilities.json).

## Recommended workflow

1. Validate the current file before editing:

```shell
uv run python scripts/manage_converter_capabilities.py validate
```

2. If adding a new converter, scaffold a valid section instead of writing one manually:

```shell
uv run python scripts/manage_converter_capabilities.py add --id my-format --name "My Format"
```

3. Edit the generated entry fields in [converter-capabilities.json](../converter-capabilities.json).

4. Render the documentation after editing. This validates the file, rewrites it in normalized form, and regenerates both the Markdown and HTML capability reports, so there is no separate normalize step to remember:

```shell
uv run python scripts/render_converter_capabilities.py
```

If validation fails, the command exits without writing anything — fix the reported errors and run it again.

You can still validate or normalize on their own while iterating:

```shell
uv run python scripts/manage_converter_capabilities.py validate
uv run python scripts/manage_converter_capabilities.py normalize
```

## Required fields per converter

Every converter entry must include these fields:

- id
- name
- package
- status
- extensions
- platform
- import
- export
- limitations

## Field glossary

- schema_version: Registry schema version in major.minor format.
- maintainers_note: Maintainer-facing note about how and when to update/regenerate artifacts.
- converters: List of converter capability entries.
- id: Stable converter identifier (lowercase slug, for example obj).
- name: Human-readable converter name.
- package: Python package name; must match id pattern evo-data-converters-{id}.
- status: Lifecycle status (implemented, template_only, planned).
- extensions: One or more primary source file extensions accepted by the converter.
- platform: Runtime/platform notes and prerequisites.
- import.supported: Whether import to Evo is supported.
- import.source_types: Source-domain data types accepted by import.
- import.produces_evo_objects: Evo object types produced by import.
- export.supported: Whether export from Evo is supported.
- export.supports_evo_objects: Evo object types accepted for export.
- limitations: Known behavior limits, constraints, or caveats.

## Common mistakes caught by validation

- Duplicate converter ids
- Missing import/export subfields
- Non-string entries in arrays
- Package not matching id pattern, for example id xyz must use package evo-data-converters-xyz
